# Jumplink Generator

## What is this?

As of now, this webapp extracts url enpoints from a \<a href=".../#endpoint">...\</a> type structure. And then inserts the endpoints as IDs into \<h3> tags. A very specific task for the content ops dreamteam!

Want to improve on this? Could use an auto copy to clipboard function, better styling, or anything you think of. I don't know what I'm doing, just pretending to. Fork this and send a pull request, I'd be overjoyed.
